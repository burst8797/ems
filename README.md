The thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of energetic compounds is an important proxy of their thermal stability and an essential criterion for the molecular design of energetic materials (EMs). To enhance the generalisation and predictive accuracy of the existing models, this study proposes a deep learning based approach for Td prediction. Dataset comprising 1,120 high-energy compounds, each represented by canonical simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings and experimentally measured Td values. A dual-channel multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Transformer model was created to combine molecular fingerprints and SMILES sequences through parallel encoding pathways and cross-attention mechanisms. This multichannel architecture enables the effective fusion of structural and sequential information, thereby boosting accuracy. The model achieved a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE = 28°C) and a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.67) relative to conventional machine learning models and single-channel Transformers. The superior performance of the MLP-Transformer demonstrates an ability to capture complex structure–property relationships in energetic compounds. This study offers a robust and extensible framework for deep learning applications for the property prediction of energetic materials.
